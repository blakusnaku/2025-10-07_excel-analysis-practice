# 🧩 Excel Analysis Practice  
**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Focus:** Conditional Formatting, Lookup Functions, and Data Cleaning  

---

## 🎯 Overview
This practice project simulates real-world Excel data analysis and cleaning workflows.  
It covers three key skill areas:

1. **Conditional Formatting** — visualizing data with heat maps, icon sets, and rules.  
2. **Lookup Functions** — using `VLOOKUP` and `INDEX-MATCH` for data referencing.  
3. **Data Cleaning** — applying formulas and logical rules to create a final, analysis-ready dataset.

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `raw_data.xlsx` | Original unprocessed dataset used as the base for all exercises. |
| `conditional_formatting_practice.xlsx` | Conditional formatting drills including top 10% highlights, heat maps, icon sets, and combined rules. |
| `cleaned_data_final.xlsx` | Final cleaned dataset after applying logical rules, standardizing formats, and fixing missing values. |
| `_cleaning_log.xlsx` | Step-by-step documentation of the cleaning process with reflections on formulas and transformations. |

## 🧮 Key Excel Skills Practiced
- **Conditional Formatting**
  - Top 10% rules and icon sets  
  - Combined logical rules using formulas (`AND`, `OR`)  
  - Custom 3-color heat maps  

- **Lookup Functions**
  - `VLOOKUP` for vertical referencing  
  - `INDEX` + `MATCH` for flexible lookups  

- **Data Cleaning**
  - Case normalization (`PROPER`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`)  
  - Date standardization (`TEXT`, `DATEVALUE`)  
  - Logical replacements for missing values (`IF`, `ISBLANK`)

## 🧠 Reflection
This exercise improved my ability to:
- Combine multiple Excel functions in realistic cleaning scenarios.  
- Structure workbooks into professional pipelines (raw → cleaned → log).  
- Document cleaning steps clearly for reproducibility.
